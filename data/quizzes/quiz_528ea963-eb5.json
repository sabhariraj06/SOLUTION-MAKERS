    {
      "question": "What is image classification in the context of deep learning?",
      "options": {
        "a": "Labelling the entire image with an object or concept with confidence.",
        "b": "Identifying the gender of a person from their face image.",
        "c": "Tagging photos with their respective categories.",
        "d": "Recognizing the type of pet in a photo."
      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Image classification is defined as labelling the whole image with an object or concept, along with a confidence level. It involves assigning a class to an entire image, which is the process described in option (a)."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following is a key feature of Deep Neural Networks?",
      "options": {
        "a": "A type of artificial neural network with multiple layers.",
        "b": "A method for data compression.",
        "c": "A programming language used in TensorFlow.",
        "d": "A technique for noise reduction in images."
      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are a specific type of artificial neural network characterized by having multiple layers between the input and output layers, as described in option (a)."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the primary function of a hidden layer in a Deep Neural Network?",
      "options": {
        "a": "Receiving input data.",
        "b": "Performing feature extraction and transformation.",
        "c": "Producing the final output of the network.",
        "d": "Updating weights and biases during training."
      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Hidden layers in DNNs serve as intermediate layers where complex features are extracted from raw input data, as mentioned in option (b)."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the main distinction between TensorFlow 1.x and TensorFlow 2.x?",
      "options": {
        "a": "TensorFlow 1.x uses eager execution by default.",
        "b": "TensorFlow 2.x employs graph execution as its primary approach.",
        "c": "Both versions support automatic differentiation for gradient-based optimization.",
        "d": "TensorFlow 2.x introduces a new, more user-friendly API."
      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The key difference between TensorFlow 1.x and TensorFlow 2.x is that the latter enables eager execution by default, executing operations immediately as they are defined, while TensorFlow 1.x required building a computational graph and then executing it within a session."
