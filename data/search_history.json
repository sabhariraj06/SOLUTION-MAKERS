[{"question": "key features of keras", "answer": "Key Features of Keras:\n1. User-Friendly: Keras provides a simple, consistent interface optimized for common use cases, which allows for easy and fast prototyping.\n2. Modular: A model is understood as a sequence or a graph of standalone, fully-configurable modules that can be connected together.\n3. Extensible: New modules can be easily added, and it allows for total customization in the building process.\n4. Multi-Backend and Multi-Platform: It can run seamlessly on CPU and GPU and can be deployed on various platforms, such as mobile devices using TensorFlow Lite.", "timestamp": "2025-09-17 22:46:02", "pdf_name": "CV.pdf"}]
